plv8 (1.4.0-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Manually loop over the versions to build/install instead of using
    pg_buildext because the buildsystem doesn't like "srcdir" in the
    environment.
  * Remove 8.4 from debian/pgversions as it fails on i386 (amd64 works).
  * Makefile: use pg_config --includedir-server so we get the version
    number for the right PostgreSQL version.
  * Run make installcheck using autopkgtest. (Needs postgresql-common >= 146).
  * Point Vcs headers at anonscm.debian.org.
